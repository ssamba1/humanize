"""untell — closed-loop, detector-feedback AI-text humanizer packaged as a Claude skill.

The runnable Python lives in two places:
  - ``untell.scripts`` — score / preserve / quality helpers the skill shells out to.
  - ``untell.detectors`` — tiered detector adapters behind a common protocol.

The ``lite`` tier runs on the standard library alone (no model downloads); ``full`` and
``heavy`` tiers activate automatically when their optional dependencies are installed.
