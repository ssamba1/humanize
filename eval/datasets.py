"""Dataset loading for the benchmark.

Pulls AI-generated samples to untell. Uses HuggingFace ``datasets`` when the ``[eval]`` extra
is installed; otherwise falls back to a small built-in bootstrap sample so the harness still
runs (and tests pass) with zero downloads.

Supported names:
  - ``hc3``   -> Hello-SimpleAI/HC3 ChatGPT answers
  - ``raid``  -> liamdugan/raid machine-generated split
  - ``mage``  -> yaful/MAGE machine-generated (label 0) samples
  - ``builtin`` (default fallback) -> packaged sample paragraphs
